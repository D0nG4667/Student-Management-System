# Student-Management-System

<a name="readme-top"></a>

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to build a simple Student Management System. This system will allow the management of students, courses, and enrollments, demonstrating the use of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Description  

A Student Management System showcasing Object-Oriented Programming principles. Includes classes for `Person`, `Student`, `Instructor`, `Course`, and `Enrollment`, with functionalities for managing students, instructors, courses, and enrollments, including adding, updating, and retrieving data as listed below.

- Add, remove, and update students and instructors
- Add, remove, and update courses
- Enroll students in courses
- Assign grades to students for specific courses
- Retrieve a list of students enrolled in a specific course
- Retrieve a list of courses a specific student is enrolled in

**NB:** Person class has a method for generating ID based on the type of person, Instructor INS---, Student STU---

## Sample Code

```sh
    from utils.pydantic.student_management_system import Student, Instructor, Course, StudentManagementSystem

    # Create an instance of the student management system
    sms = StudentManagementSystem()

    # Create the student instance
    student = Student(first_name='Gabriel', last_name='Okundaye',
                      major=Major.COMPUTER_SCIENCE)

    # Create the instructor instance
    instructor = Instructor(first_name='Guido', last_name='Rossum',
                            department=Department.COMPUTER_SCIENCE)

    # Create the course instance
    course = Course(course_name_id=CourseNameId.INTRO_TO_PROGRAMMING)
```
